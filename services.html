            <h4>Our Focus...</h4>
            <p>Our classes help your child develop the required literacy skills needed when starting kindergarten. We provide the tools for children to start learning phonemic awareness, comprehension, letter formation, pencil & scissor grip and fine/gross motor skills.
            We also help improve numeracy skills with counting, number recognition, patterns and exposure to mathematical language. Our students love their new found freedom when taught social skills and independence such as packing and carrying their own school bag, problem solving, cooperative play and tidying up after themselves.

            We can support your child to enrich their emotional skills with self regulation,  resilience building, persistence and improved confidence.

                  <p>We provide students going into their first year of formal schooling with a head start by offering a taste test of what the first week of school will be like. We focus on skills that students are expected to have when they first start kindergarten. Being Kindergarten teachers ourselves, we know this is not always possible, so we provide a fast track run down of what is expected for both student and parents.</p>

                  <h4>Literacy</h4>
                  <p>We work on letter identification, letter sounds and writing single letters correctly in a rotation style lesson similar to most kindergarten classrooms. Students will have one-on-one time with a teacher during these activities. 
                    .</p>

                  <h4>Lunch Time</h4>
                    <p>After eating, students will practice packing up and putting their belongings away including lunch boxes, jumpers or jackets, hats, toys and rubbish in the bin. Students are encouraged to talk and play together with their new classmates. .</p>

                  <h4>Morning Tea</h4>
                  <p>Independence and listening to instruction is key here! Students will gather their food and drink bottle and find a place to sit with the group. In Kindergarten, students are expected to peel, unwrap and open any food products from their own lunchbox. We teach students to ask for help if required.

                  <p>This is a time to settle our bodies and prepare for the next lesson. We might read a story and have a Q&A session, have someone tell their news if they are confident enough, sing songs, yoga or meditation.</p>

                    <p>Art focuses more so on following and listening to instruction and using the skills taught. These skills include cutting, ripping, collaging, gluing, painting, drawing and colouring. Our studentsâ€™ love listening to music and taking time to reflect on their day during this time. </p>
